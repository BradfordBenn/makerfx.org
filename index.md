description: >
  MakerFX Makerspace is a community makerspace in South Orlando. We welcome makers of all types, from crafters to artists to robotics builders.
  Whatever you like to make, you'll find a welcoming community that can help you learn, and wants to learn from you.
  We are active in the local community and you'll often find MakerFX members showing off what they make at events, volunteering
  with community projects, partnering with organizations like Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Florida, and much, much more.
  We also like to work collaboratively with other Orlando Makerspaces such as FamiLAB and Factur.
