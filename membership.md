## FAQs

#### What are the differences in membership levels?

The standard membership with 24×7 access is $50 for an individual, and $75 for a family living in the same household.
The booster membership is for the individual (or family) that wants to give a little extra support to the community in this way. (There are many other ways you can help the community – like volunteering!) You get all the same member benefits of the standard level, and a bit of extra gratitude.
<br><br>
#### What is the minimum membership age?

Members must be 18 or older. Minors can accompany their adult parent, and can be unaccompanied at events that specifically allow unaccompanied minors.
Minors are restricted from using specific tools without direct supervision from parent or legal guardian.
<br><br>
#### What tools are available for members?

This list may vary (typically gets longer!) – we currently have the following tools (and more!):
- Laser cutter / engraver (36×24 bed, 50 watt) with rotary tool
- Multiple 3D printers: DeltaMaker and Creality CR-10
- Forest Scientific CNC 5x10 Router
- Grizzly Vertical Mill (G0755)
- TIG Welder (Alpha-TIG 200X)
- Vinyl Cutter
- Screenprinting gear
- Various woodworking tools including a SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw
- Electronics workbench including soldering stations, oscilloscope, bench power supply

<br><br>

#### How do I get trained on tools?

Most training at MakerFX is 1:1 - while we do host group classes, we don't want you to have to wait until the next scheduled class.
The best way for a member to get training is to go to the Slack channel for that tool, and ask for help. One of our members will schedule a time with you and show you what they know.
<br><br>
#### Do some tools require training before use?

Absolutely - some of our larger, more expensive (and more dangerous) tools require training and a "check out" process before use. If you are new to MakerFX
this is a great topic for your orientation, and we can pair you with another member to make this happen quickly.
<br><br>
#### Do you have a business membership?

At this time, we do not have business memberships. MakerFX space and tools may be used for business prototyping and design work, but should not be used for production of goods sold, or to stock your online store.

A simple way to think through this – if you are calculating the cost of a MakerFX membership into your budget for your business – large or small, then you are thinking of a business membership, which we do not have. [Factur](https://www.factur.org>) has business memberships and may be better suited to help your business grow.

If your business would like to purchase memberships for your staff as a benefit, or if you would like to support MakerFX as a sponsor with sponsor benefits, we are happy to create a custom program for you. Please email <info@makerfx.org> to discuss.
<br><br>
#### Do you require a minimum length of membership?

We do not have a minimum membership term, however we respectfully discourage short-term membership. There is a time commitment from our all-volunteer team to get a new member enrolled, oriented, and trained on specific tools, and we'd prefer to do this for those who are joining the community, not just looking for a specific tool to complete one project.
<br><br>
#### Do you have discounted plans for students, retirees, or others?

We are happy to discuss your individual situation. There are other ways to contribute to our community (such as teaching, helping clean the space, contributing to group project, etc.) and we are happy to work something out if you are looking to make a contribution. Email us at <info@makerfx.org> to discuss.
<br><br>
#### If I'm not a member, can I participate in online discussion, group projects, volunteer, etc?
Absolutely! Email us at <info@makerfx.org> to request an invite to our Slack workspace where we communicate about tools & projects as well as post about group projects and volunteer opportunities.
<br><br>
#### How do I cancel my MakerFX membership?
1. Go to your PayPal account, find your subscriptions page (it is a bit hidden on the PayPal site, you may need to search for it), and cancel the monthly MakerFX subscription.
2. Email us at <treasurer@makerfx.org> to make us aware you are cancelling your membership.
3. Don't forget to grab any materials / projects you have at the space!
