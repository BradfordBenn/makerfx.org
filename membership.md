# Membership {#services}

MakerFX needs your support to exist.  We love our 5,500 sq. ft. space, but the rent is over $5,000 per month before utilities and other operating costs. Your monthly membership helps this maker community exist, and provides you 24×7 access to the makerspace, its tools and other resources.

Due to the pandemic, we have stopped our Open Make events and we are doing tours by appointment only. Please email info@makerfx.org with any questions, or to setup a tour. When you are ready to apply to become a member, please use the links below to setup automatic payment. We will initiate the membership process for you.

# FAQs

## What are the differences in membership levels?

The standard membership with 24×7 access is $50 for an individual, and $75 for a family living in the same household.
The booster membership is for the individual (or family) that wants to give a little extra support to the community in this way. (There are many other ways you can help the community – like volunteering!) You get all the same member benefits of the standard level, and a bit of extra gratitude.

## What is the minimum membership age?

Members must be 18 or older. Minors can accompany their adult parent, and can be unaccompanied at events that specifically allow unaccompanied minors.
Minors are restricted from using specific tools without direct supervision from parent or legal guardian.

## What tools are available for members?

This list may vary (typically gets longer!) – we currently have the following tools (and more):
- Laser cutter / engraver (36×24 bed, 50 watt) with rotary tool
- Forest Scientific CNC 5x10 Router
- Vinyl Cutter
- Multiple 3D printers: DeltaMaker and Creality CR-10
- Screenprinting gear
- Various woodworking tools including a SawStop Professional Cabinet Saw
- Electronics workbench including soldering stations, oscilloscope, bench power supply

## Do you have a business membership?

At this time, we do not have business memberships. MakerFX space and tools may be used for business prototyping and design work, but should not be used for production of goods sold, or to stock your online store. We are currently working on a more detailed guideline for this topic – if you have questions – please email <info@makerfx.org> to discuss.

A simple way to think through this – if you are calculating the cost of a MakerFX membership into your budget for your business – large or small, then you are thinking of a business membership, which we do not have. [Factur](https://www.factur.org>) has business memberships and may be better suited to help your business grow.
